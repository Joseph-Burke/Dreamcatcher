# README

In development, this README file will serve as a log of my progress and my considerations of the project.

## Project Goals

This project will

- Allow users to log in and view information about their own personal goals.
- Allow users to create life goals. Every life goal will be connected to a 'family tree' of other goals. For example 'Maintain good hygiene' might have 'Shower every day' as one of its sub-goals and 'Improve self-confidence' as a super-goal.
- Look good on the eyes. The design of the website will be pleasing and the experience of using it should be pleasant.
- Be accessible and enjoyable across all devices.

## To Do

1. Create basic functionality. Create a Devise-authenticated User Object.
2. Each user will have a number of dreams/goals associated with it.


FOR THE FIRST ITERATION OF THIS PROJECT, I WON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOALS. JUST SAVE A USER'S GOALS AND DISPLAY THEM.
